      <h3> Data Visualization:
I decided to use the growth of flowers, the size and orientation of their stems, and the amount of their petals to depict the songs I had listened to during the week long collection period. Each day is presented by a flower that is rooted on the noon x-axis. I also spoke on the changing ways that artists are releasing their music due to the listening habits of fans.

      <article><h6> Video Explanation :
        For the research portion of this assignment, I focused on the Spotify curated playlists, the Discover Weekly, and especially the Release Radar. The implications that these algorithims and playlists have upon the music industry is surprsingly signicifiant. There is a recognizable difference to how artists release their music now that streaming services like Spotify and Pandora are the most used means of acquiring music.
